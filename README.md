# Noob-s-Football-Project

Welcome!

Here you will find the code and the subsequent files you need to download, to create a table which will provide you with the effect of red cards, substitutions and goals on the TS(Team Strength), GD(Goal Difference), TR(Time Remaining) for the Premier League 2017-2018.

Don't forget to download all the files and change their locations on the code.

PS: Forgive me for not commenting on my code, I will do it whenever I next get the time. Have fun!
